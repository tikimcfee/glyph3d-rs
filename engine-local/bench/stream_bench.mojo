# stream_bench.mojo — streaming a whole DIRECTORY, and what the arena costs.
#
# The scaling benchmark measured one big file. That is not the shape the app has:
# a repo is tens of thousands of items, not one 28MB blob. This measures the shape
# that matters, and the claim the record format exists to make:
#
#   SCRATCH is per-JOB and reused, so it stays flat no matter how large the corpus.
#   RECORDS are per-GLYPH and resident, so they grow with content and nothing else.
#
# Under the old arena both of those were one number — 48 B per source byte held for
# the corpus's lifetime, so the ceiling was a function of total bytes. Here the
# ceiling is a function of the LARGEST SINGLE ITEM, and the resident cost is a
# function of rendered glyphs. Those are different questions with different answers,
# which is the whole point of separating them.
#
# Takes a manifest (one path per line) so the walk is the shell's job, not this
# file's — `find <dir> -type f > manifest`.
#
# Run: mojo run -I engine engine/bench/stream_bench.mojo <fixture.pipe.bin> <manifest>
