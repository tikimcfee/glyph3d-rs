# conformance.mojo — replay oracle fixtures through the native pipeline, diff bits.
#
# Loads fixtures written by engine/fixtures/gen.mjs (the JS oracle's inputs and
# answers) and runs run_pipeline. The assertion is SCOPE B (the contract's tiers,
# applied to the corpus):
#
#   bit-for-bit   the WIRE — fixture measure lanes 0-5 (X Y Z ADVANCE HEIGHT
#                 GLYPH_ID) as u32 patterns, counts ROW/COL/FLAGS exactly, f64
#                 bounds as u64 patterns, leaders and misses exactly. No
#                 tolerances — a tolerance would hide exactly the
#                 grouping-dependent float drift this suite exists to catch.
#   semantic      the ord witness (ordToByte[byteStart + ord] == id, ords a
#                 permutation per item) in place of pinning ORD's value and
#                 ordToByte's contents.
#   unasserted    BASE_X, LINE_ADV — fold scratch; container choices a
#                 specialized backend may re-lay or elide. Pinned where they are
#                 load-bearing instead: conformance_scan reads them through X.
#
# (The scan form compares TIERED instead — conformance_scan.mojo — because
# foldless float lanes differ from the serial fold by construction.)
#
# Run: mojo run -I engine engine/conformance.mojo engine/fixtures/*.pipe.bin
