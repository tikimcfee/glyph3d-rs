# glyph_record.mojo — the record format, and the scratch pool it makes possible.
#
# THE PROBLEM. A source byte costs slot lanes held for the corpus's entire
# lifetime. But the render path reads only the render-read prefixes; BASE_X is
# FOLD SCRATCH (paginate's input), and LINE_ADV/ORD/ord_to_byte are WITNESS
# TIER - the read-axis split moved them out of the render-read arrays entirely,
# and run_streaming below runs the fold ELIDED (witness=False), so they are
# never even written here. The arena otherwise pays corpus-scale memory for
# job-scale temporaries, on every byte.
#
# THE PREFIX RULE MAKES EMIT CHEAP. The schema orders render-read lanes FIRST
# in every phase array, so emitting a record is a concatenation of THREE runs
# (posMeasures 0-3, staticMeasures 0-3, posCounts WHOLE) - a truncation per
# array, never a gather through a lane map. Checked twice over: gen-schema.mjs
# refuses a schema where a render-read lane sorts after an unread one, and pins
# the wire order as a literal so a container re-layout cannot move the bytes.
#
# THE DECOUPLING. Once records exist, slots become a SCRATCH POOL sized to the
# JOB, not the corpus. run_streaming below proves it: a fixed pool, reused across
# chunks, with resident cost equal to records alone. Corpus size stops determining
# arena size — which is a different kind of win from any multiplier on the old
# form, and it is what makes streaming edits a range re-run rather than a reload.

# that gets regrouped in parallel would drift. (This is the same reason segAdv is

    """The fold state at a LINE START — checkpoint lookup, nothing re-summed.

    WHY LINE STARTS. The fold carries five accumulators. The monoid carries the two
    that are pure counts (base_row, ord). It cannot carry the other three:

      line_adv  an f64 chain — f64 addition is not associative, so a monoid that
                gets regrouped in parallel would drift (the same reason segAdv is
                summed f32-per-add rather than in f64).
      seg_adv   resets at every FOLD boundary, and fold is wrap-or-page-cols — a
                QUERY parameter. The bake is deliberately wrap-agnostic, so a
                per-segment sum cannot live in it.
      col       likewise per-line.

    At a line start all three are zero BY DEFINITION, so the monoid carries
    everything that is left and the seed needs no re-summing at all. That is not a
    workaround: a line is the natural resume unit, it is what the arena's own
    design study already proposed ("large files chunked at newline boundaries"),
    and it is how edits actually arrive.

    Resuming mid-line is possible — re-sum line_adv from the line start and seg_adv
    from the segment start, both bounded spans — but it buys nothing an edit needs
    and costs two more things that can silently disagree with the fold.

    WHY base_row_hint EXISTS, and it is a real limit rather than an oversight.
    `scan_combine` accumulates `rows` using the wrap carried in the element, and
    `bake_file` bakes at wrap = 0 ON PURPOSE — wrap is a QUERY parameter, which is
    exactly why `rows_under_wrap` is a separate histogram query rather than a field.
    So for an UNWRAPPED item (fold == 0) the prefix's row count is exact and the
    bake alone can seed a resume. For a wrapped or paged item it cannot, because
    the answer depends on a wrap the bake deliberately does not know.

    Rather than return a plausible wrong number, the caller must supply the row.
    That is not a burden in practice: anything re-laying a range has already laid
    the document once, and the row of the line being edited is in the previous
    layout. Passing -1 with wrap > 0 raises instead of guessing."""
