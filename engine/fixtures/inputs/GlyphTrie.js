/**
 * GlyphTrie — codepoint → glyph metrics, as a GPU-indexable two-level trie.
 *
 * The GPU resolves a decoded codepoint to its glyph with two dependent loads and no
 * hashing:
 *
 *     block = blockIndex[cp >> 8]                    // u32[4352], covers all of Unicode
 *     entry = blocks[(block << 8 | (cp & 0xFF)) * 4] // {glyphId, advance, height, flags}
 *
 * BOTH buffers are Uint32Array. The entry mixes two KINDS and the container carries them
 * the way the slot buffer does: glyphId and flags are exact identities/bitfields stored
 * NATIVELY, advance and height are measures stored as BITCAST f32. See ENTRY_STRIDE.
 *
 * This is the standard Unicode property trie (ICU's UTrie2 shape, one level shallower).
 * It replaces hashing the character and matching hashes to atlas slots: no collisions to
 * resolve, no probe loop, no chance two codepoints alias. A miss is a VALUE, not a
 * failure — unmapped codepoints resolve to the shared missing block, whose entries carry
 * FLAG_MISSING, and the kernel appends them to a miss list for the CPU to encode and
 * upload. The layout is correct either way; the glyph is just blank until the atlas
 * catches up.
 *
 * Blocks are deduplicated by content, which is what keeps it small: source code touches a
 * few hundred codepoints spread over a handful of Unicode blocks, so almost every one of
 * the 4352 block slots points at the shared missing block. A full Latin+punctuation+box-
 * drawing+emoji working set lands in tens of KB, uploaded once at boot rather than per
 * grid.
 *
 * Worker-safe: no DOM, no three.

 * died of: exact-in-practice on a float carrier is a bound nobody is checking, and it
