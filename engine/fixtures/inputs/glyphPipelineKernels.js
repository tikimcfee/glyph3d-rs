/**
 * glyphPipelineKernels — the byte-in glyph pipeline as WebGPU compute, in TSL.
 *
 * A transcription of the SCAN SPEC (`glyphPipelineScan.js`), whose semantics are the
 * oracle (`glyphPipelineReference.js`). Both are proven headlessly
 * (tools/scan-layout.test.mjs, tools/glyph-pipeline.test.mjs); this is the same
 * algorithm addressed to the GPU. Keep them dispatch-for-dispatch comparable — when
 * they diverge, the spec is right until a test says otherwise.
 *
 * THE FOLD IS A SEGMENTED MONOID SCAN, not a walk. Every byte contributes a small
 * summary (newlines, closed rows, head/tail run lengths, tail advance, ordinal; item
 * starts are ABSORBING RESETS); a leader's exclusive prefix yields its exact
 * row/col/ord in O(1). The shape is a RAKING reduce-then-scan, chosen for what it
 * does NOT need:
 *
 *   - no cross-thread read of anything a sibling wrote in the same dispatch
 *     (every dispatch's read set is a PREVIOUS dispatch's write set)
 *   - no workgroup shared memory, no barriers, no forward-progress assumption
 *   - no coherence window, no publish race, no schedule-dependent cost
 *   - every loop bounded by a compile-time constant
 *
 * Work is O(n); the result is bit-deterministic under every schedule.
 *
 * NINE DISPATCHES PER LOAD, not per frame (the five scan stages are the walk's
 * replacement; per-storm dispatch overhead is microseconds):
 *
 *   1. decodeAndResolve   bytes → codepoint → trie → glyphId/advance/height. Per byte.
 *   2. chunkReduce        serial fold of CHUNK_SIZE leaves → partials.   Per chunk.
 *   3. spineReduce        serial fold of GROUP_SIZE partials → supers.   Per group.
 *   4. spineScan          exclusive scan of supers.                      ONE thread.
 *   5. partialScan        group-seeded exclusive scan → partialPrefix.   Per group.
 *   6. apply              prefix through the chunk's leaves → the exact lanes
 *                         (row/col/lineAdv/ord) + the ordinal map.       Per chunk.
 *   7. resolveX           fold-relative x by re-summing ≤ fold advances through the
 *                         ordinal map (forward from the segment start — the exact f32
 *                         order the oracle accumulates, so fold > 0 x is bit-identical
 *                         to the CPU); foldless x is the line prefix. Writes the
 *                         unpaginated position + the per-item FOLD SCALARS reduce
 *                         (totalRows, item-relative widest row).         Per byte.
 *   8. deriveStrides      page-fan stride = widest row + pageGapX.       Per item.
 *   9. paginateAndBounds  pure per-slot remap from base + integer lanes, with the
 *                         per-item BOX reduce fused on.                  Per byte.
 *
 * Pagination (with strides) stays separately dispatchable: a mode switch or scroll
 * re-runs ONLY 8+9 over positions that already exist. And because resolveX reads the
 * fold unit from the ITEM TABLE at its own dispatch, a pageCols change re-runs 7-9 —
 * no re-scan, no re-decode (the scan never sees the fold unit's width, only wrap).
 *
 * ── MULTI-FILE (the item table) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One pipeline instance serves N files in ONE byte buffer. An item owns an EXPLICIT
 * byte range [byteStart, byteStart + byteCount): byteStart goes in itemStarts (the
 * binary-search key — the table is always packed sorted by byteStart) and byteCount in
 * the I_BYTE_COUNT item-table lane. Items are sorted but need NOT be contiguous: the
 * arena's free-list recycles tombstoned ranges, so dead gaps sit between live ranges.
 * A gap byte attributes to the preceding item under the search, but apply kills its
 * leader flag (out of its item's range), so resolveX/paginate skip it — no fold-scalar
 * or box reduce can ever be polluted by dead content. Contiguous layouts (the spec's
 * and the reference oracle's domain) are the degenerate case: every byte is in range
 * and the guard never fires. Item isolation stays ALGEBRAIC: an item start is a reset
 * element that absorbs everything left of it under any grouping — row/col are
 * file-relative and no state can leak across files, structurally.
 *
 * BOUNDS ARE PER-ITEM, GPU-owned: resolveX reduces the fold scalars into foldScalars,
 * deriveStrides turns lane 1 (+ pageGapX) into itemStrides, and paginate reduces each
 * item's final box into itemBoxes. readItemBounds() is ONE readback handing every
 * staged field its extent — the CPU never re-lays a file to learn its size.
 *
 * ── VERIFIED ON HARDWARE (tools/glyph-pipeline-check.mjs) ──────────────────────────
 * GPU output diffs against runPipeline() (the oracle) on the same bytes, over
 * torture / 40k-single-line / real-file corpora at wrap 0/24/200 and every page mode.
 * Integer lanes must be BIT-EXACT everywhere — the scan is deterministic, so unlike
 * the old walk there is no "within f32 accumulation noise" carve-out for fold > 0 x.
