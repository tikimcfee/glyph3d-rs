/**
 * glyphPipelineReference — the byte-in glyph pipeline's executable spec, in JS.
 *
 * The pipeline takes a file's UTF-8 BYTES and produces positions and bounds. It never
 * sees a JavaScript string, never splits on newlines, and builds no line table — the
 * CPU's entire job is moving bytes from the socket into a buffer.
 *
 * This module is the SEMANTIC ORACLE: `runPipeline` computes the one true answer with
 * the simplest possible serial code (one forward pass per item). The GPU reaches the
 * same answer by a parallel prefix SCAN — that algorithm's executable spec lives in
 * `glyphPipelineScan.js`, structured dispatch-for-dispatch like the TSL, and is proven
 * against this oracle headlessly. Three layers, one contract:
 *
 *   oracle (this file)  →  scan spec (glyphPipelineScan.js)  →  TSL kernels
 *        semantics             algorithm, CPU-testable            same code on hardware
 *
 * The per-slot KERNEL functions here (decodeAndResolve, resolveX, paginate,
 * boundsReduce) are shared verbatim by the oracle and the scan spec — only the
 * row/col derivation differs (serial fold here, monoid scan there).
 *
 * BYTE-INDEXED THROUGHOUT. One slot per BYTE, not per glyph: a continuation byte of a
 * multi-byte sequence stays a non-leader and is skipped by every later pass. A slot
 * index is identical to a source byte offset, so picking, tree-sitter ranges, and the
 * cursor all address the same space with no mapping table anywhere — every glyph is a
 * particle with a stable address.
 *
 * ROW and COL are the reason this works. They are exact integers — a count of visual
 * rows and a count of glyphs since the last newline — and EVERY DISCRETE DECISION reads
 * them, never the float position. f32 addition is not associative: two summation
 * groupings land a few ULPs apart, and `floor(y / pageHeight)` at a page boundary flips
 * a glyph a whole page on a 1-ULP wobble. Integers do not wobble.
 *
 * X PRECISION follows the same discipline: a glyph's x is the sum of its FOLD UNIT's
 * advances (at most `fold` small numbers), never the difference of two file-scale
 * prefix sums — differencing f32 prefixes loses ~ULP(prefix) absolute, which on a
 * 40k-glyph line is 100× a caret width. Only the foldless case (wrap 0, pageCols 0)
 * uses the line prefix directly, where the position IS the prefix and f32
 * representation of the position itself is the only limit.
 *
 * ── MULTI-FILE (the item table) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One pipeline run serves N files concatenated in ONE byte buffer. Each file is an
 * ITEM: { byteStart, byteCount, origin, page, wrapWidth?, zStep?, lineHeight? }. A
 * per-slot pass resolves its item by binary search over byteStarts; the row/col fold
 * RESETS at every item start (in the scan, item starts are absorbing monoid resets —
 * isolation is structural, not a floored walk), so row/col are FILE-RELATIVE and no
 * state can leak across files. wrap/zStep/lineHeight are per-item lanes with
 * field-level defaults: one arena serves grids that fold differently (a filename at
 * wrap 0 beside content at wrap 200).
 *
 * BOUNDS ARE PER-ITEM: the GPU carries a maxItems×8 bounds table — resolveX reduces
 * the fold scalars (lanes 6/7: totalRows + the ITEM-RELATIVE widest row) and the
 * paginate kernel reduces the final box (lanes 0-5) — so ONE post-flush readback hands
 * every field its extent. This mirror computes the same per-item table (`itemBounds`);
 * the batch box is the union. The page-fan stride DERIVES from lane 7 + the item's
 * pageGapX (`deriveStride`, the one shared formula) — a measured content width, never
 * a CPU-supplied stride.
 *
 * A single file is the one-item case: opts.origin/opts.page/opts.scrollRows wrap into
 * one item spanning the buffer.
 *
 * Worker-safe: no DOM, no three.

// one type — so one kind travels reinterpreted.
//
// COUNTS (S_ROW/S_COL/S_FLAGS/S_ORD) are stored natively and are now exact for
// the full u32 range. That is the whole point: they used to ride f32 lanes,
// where consecutive integers stop being representable past 2^24 and two glyphs
// fold onto one ordinal while addressing stays perfectly exact.
//
// FLOATS (S_ADVANCE/S_HEIGHT/S_X/S_Y/S_Z/S_BASE_X/S_LINE_ADV) are bitcast. This
// is the direction that costs nothing: a bitcast is a reinterpretation, so all
// 32 bits survive and the round-trip is exact — unlike the int-in-float it
// replaces, which destroyed information.
//
// fbits() also PRESERVES THE ROUNDING. Storing into a Float32Array rounded to
// f32 implicitly, and the oracle's whole discipline depends on that happening
// at exactly the same points; the Float32Array staging view below rounds
// identically, so no store changes value.

 * KERNEL — thread per byte. RESOLVE X from the exact lanes, and place the unpaginated

 *
 * The fold unit is the wrap width when wrapping, else the item's pageCols when
 * x-paginating. With a fold unit, x re-sums the glyph's `col % fold` same-row
 * predecessors — each found in O(1) through the ordinal map (leaders in one line are
 * consecutive ordinals; no newline can intervene inside a fold unit). At most `fold`
 * small advances sum in f32: exact to representation, never a difference of file-scale
 * prefixes. Foldless, x IS the line prefix (S_LINE_ADV).
 *
 * Also reduces the item's FOLD SCALARS (lanes 6/7 of the bounds table): totalRows =
 * max(row+1) and the item-relative widest row max(x) — reduced HERE, before paginate,
 * because the page-fan stride derives from lane 7 and paginate reads it.
 *
 * Cross-thread reads: previous passes' lanes + the ordinal map. Writes: S_BASE_X,
 * S_X/S_Y/S_Z, the scalar reduce. Read set and write set are disjoint lanes —
 * deterministic under any schedule.
