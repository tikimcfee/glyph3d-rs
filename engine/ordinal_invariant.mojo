# ordinal_invariant.mojo — the check a fixture diff structurally CANNOT make.
#
# The conformance suites compare the port against the JS oracle bit-for-bit. That
# catches any divergence between them — but it is blind to a fault they SHARE.
# The f32 ordinal wall WAS exactly such a fault: `ord` was computed exactly on
# both sides (a JS number; a Mojo Int) and quantized only on the store into an
# f32 lane. Past 2^24 both sides rounded identically, so the differ reported
# PASS while both were wrong together. The lanes are u32 today and the wall is
# gone — this suite is what proves it STAYS gone (its mutation deliberately puts
# the f32 carrier back). A correlated error is invisible to a differential test.
#
# This checks an INVARIANT instead, referencing no oracle at all. The same fact —
# "which glyph is the n-th leader of this item" — is recorded twice in different
# types:
#
#   wc[id]                                 u32 count  (exact to 2^32; the ORD
#                                          witness array — the read-axis split
#                                          moved it out of the render-read lc)
#   ord_to_byte[item.byte_start + ord]     u32 array  (exact to 2^32)
#
# So the u32 array is an independent, exact witness for the lossy lane, and
# round-tripping one through the other must be the identity:
#
#   ord_to_byte[byte_start + ord] == id    for every leader
#
# When two leaders alias onto one ordinal, the later store wins and the earlier
# glyph's round-trip lands on the wrong byte. The check fails loudly, with no
# expected-output file involved.
#
# Note this is a PER-ITEM bound, not a per-arena one: `ord` resets to 0 for each
# item (glyph_pipeline.mojo, layout loop), and ord_to_byte is indexed relative to
# byte_start. A 100MB arena of ordinary files is perfectly safe; ONE item past
# 2^24 bytes is not. The arena's global 2^24 cap in the JS side is a conservative
# proxy for this rule — it bounds the total because, in principle, one item could
# be the whole arena.
#
# Run: mojo run -I engine engine/ordinal_invariant.mojo engine/fixtures/*.pipe.bin
