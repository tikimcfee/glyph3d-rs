# glyph_pipeline.mojo — the byte-in glyph pipeline, ported to Mojo.
#
# The FOURTH layer of the pipeline contract (oracle → scan spec → TSL → this):
# a native transcription of glyphPipelineReference.js, the semantic oracle. It is
# required to reproduce the oracle's answers BIT-FOR-BIT — including its float
# discipline, which is the whole point of the exercise:
#
#   - slot lanes are f32: every store rounds once, round-to-nearest-even
#   - lineAdv accumulates in f64 (the truth layer's prefix), stored f32
#   - segAdv accumulates in f32 per add — the fold>0 x, bit-identical to the GPU's
#     forward re-sum (an f32 add IS round(exact sum), so Float32 + Float32 here
#     equals the oracle's Math.fround(f64 add of two f32-exact values))
#   - every discrete decision (rows, cols, pages, bands, segments) reads exact
#     integers, never a float position
#   - bounds boxes ride f64
#
# KERNELS TAKE POINTERS, DRIVERS SHARD THEM ACROSS CORES. The per-slot kernels
# (decode_and_resolve, resolve_x, paginate) are thread-shaped —
# `id` is the thread id, buffers are raw pointers, exactly the GPU's calling
# convention — and the drivers run them over parallelize shards. Every parallel
# reduction here is EXACT under regrouping: min/max merges and disjoint writes
# only; anything order-sensitive (the fold, miss order) stays serial. There is
# one code path — small inputs just get small shards.

# ── THE WRAP MODES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# An ITEM-LEVEL parameter, never per line and never per range.
#
#   WRAP_DOWN  a wrap advances the visual ROW. A line of n cells occupies
#              ceil(n / wrap) rows. The original behaviour and the default.
#   WRAP_BACK  a wrap does NOT advance the row. Every wrap segment of a line
#              shares ONE row and the segments stack in DEPTH, each z_step
#              further back, so a line's row is just its line index.
#
# `col` still counts within the LOGICAL line in both modes, `seg_adv` still
# resets at every fold boundary (each segment starts at x = 0), and the wrap
# SEGMENT index still exists in both — under WRAP_BACK it feeds z and no longer
# feeds row. Picking by (row, col) still resolves uniquely because col differs
# between segments.
#
# WHY IT MUST STAY ITEM-LEVEL: glyph_bake.scan_combine's junction term evaluates
# rows_for_line with `b`'s parameters, so it is not associative across a change of
# them. Mode joins wrap in that term, which makes the non-associative surface
# WIDER, not narrower. What keeps the scan form safe is structural and unchanged:
# an item boundary emits a resetting leaf, so no interval without a reset spans two

        This is what makes a chunked fold cheap. A driver that processes a
        corpus in chunks calls this once per chunk with the same result; only
        the first chunk (or a larger one) allocates, and the rest reuse. Freeing
        and reallocating per chunk would trade a memory win for allocator and
        page-fault churn — which is the exact cost the chunking exists to
        reduce, so it would be self-defeating.

        Lists only GROW: a later smaller chunk keeps the larger buffer. Peak is
        therefore set by the largest chunk, which is the number the caller
        chooses, and never by the corpus.

        The lanes are uninitialised on purpose, as they always were — coverage
        is a three-way contract (decode writes every byte, the fold zeroes
        non-leaders, the gap sweep zeroes unclaimed bytes), so REUSED memory is
        no different from fresh memory here: both are fully written before they
        are read. If that contract ever weakens, this reuse turns a latent bug
